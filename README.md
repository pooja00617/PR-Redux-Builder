Redux for State Management: Centralized and predictable state management

ESLint & Prettier: Enforces coding standards and formatting consistency

Fast Refresh: Instant feedback during development

Modular Structure: Organized folder structure for scalable applications

Production Ready: Optimized builds with Vite
